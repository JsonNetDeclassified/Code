Json.NET Declassified is a must-have book if your .NET applications communicate over the internet. Sooner or later, all web programmers are going to have to work with JSON data. When that time comes, you are going to need Json.NET, the most popular library for parsing JSON data. Json.NET is a robust library with many useful classes. But most developers use only a fraction of Json.NET's powerful capabilities. If you are already familiar with C#, then you can master Json.NET for your Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code applications by using the techniques contained in this book. With simple code samples to illustrate each concept, Json.NET Declassified takes you step-by-step, from the beginning, learning basic concepts before tackling more advanced features.

Json.NET Declassified, written by a poor, country, computer programmer from Long Beach, California, is the culmination of many years spent developing .NET e-commerce applications using Json.NET.
